"""Vertebral BODY isolation and endplate geometry.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Everything that goes wrong when you fit an endplate from a whole-vertebra mask goes
wrong for one reason: the posterior elements are still in the data. The pedicles,
lamina and spinous process sit behind the body, at endplate height, and any fit that
sees them is pulled backwards. Working around that downstream produces exactly the
symptoms we measured -- a posterior corner landing inside the spinal canal, an endplate
line crossing into the next vertebra's arch, and a `drop_post` fraction that cuts at a
different anatomic place on every level because it is a fraction of an extent that
includes the very structures it is meant to exclude.

So isolate the body FIRST. Then the endplate is unambiguous and the downstream
parameters (`drop_post`, rim bands, canal-gap searches, snap limits) are not needed at
all -- there is nothing left to exclude.

Method and prior art
--------------------
1. BODY / POSTERIOR-ELEMENT PARTITION -- the SPINAL CANAL, with watershed as a fallback.

   The canal is a topological HOLE: in an axial section the body, pedicles and lamina
   enclose it. Fill the holes slice by slice and the filled-minus-original difference IS
   the canal, with no threshold to choose. Its anterior boundary is the body's posterior
   wall -- the "posterior vertebral body line" that is read directly off a lateral film.

   A distance-transform watershed was tried first and is kept only as a fallback, because
   it assumes the body/arch junction is a THIN neck. That holds in the thoracic spine and
   fails in the lumbar, where pedicles are 8-18 mm across: measured on case 0004 it left
   L2, L3 and L4 completely unpartitioned (100% of the mask returned as "body"), and the
   endplate spans blew out to 70-92 mm as the posterior corner ran to the spinous process.
   The canal criterion has no such level dependence -- every vertebra encloses a canal.

   Watershed reference, still used when the canal cannot be recovered (an incomplete arch,
   e.g. spondylolysis, leaves no enclosed hole to fill):
   The pedicle isthmus is a thin neck joining two thick regions, which is the canonical
   watershed cut. Markers are the connected components of the mask eroded in distance
   terms (EDT >= `core_mm`), so the body core and the posterior-element core each seed
   one basin, and the flood meets at the isthmus.

       partitioning." IEEE ISBI 2006, 390-393.
     Naegel B. "Using mathematical morphology for the anatomical labeling of vertebrae
       from 3D CT-scan images." Comput Med Imaging Graph 2007;31(3):141-156.
   The body is identified as the basin containing the global distance-transform maximum
   -- the vertebral body is the thickest part of a vertebra, which holds whether or not
   the posterior elements are complete, and needs no anterior axis to be known first.

2. BODY COORDINATE SYSTEM.
     Mastmeyer A, Engelke K, Fuchs C, Kalender WA. "A hierarchical 3D segmentation
       method and the definition of vertebral body coordinate systems for QCT of the
       lumbar spine." Med Image Anal 2006;10(4):560-577.
   Mastmeyer isolate the body for the same reason we do: in QCT the posterior arch
   corrupts the measurement. We keep the patient axes rather than the body's own PCA
   axes, because every angle in ostk is defined against the patient frame and switching
   would silently redefine SS/LL.

3. ENDPLATE PLANE -- RANSAC.
     Fischler MA, Bolles RC. "Random sample consensus: a paradigm for model fitting
       with applications to image analysis and automated cartography."
       Commun ACM 1981;24(6):381-395.
   RANSAC is the standard robust estimator for exactly this failure mode: a majority of
   inliers (the endplate) plus a minority of gross outliers (an anterior osteophyte lip,
   a Schmorl's node, a segmentation spur). It replaces iterative trimming, which has no
   breakdown guarantee and which we measured failing -- residuals of 7-12 mm against
   0.5-2.5 mm on sound levels.

4. CORNERS -- the A-P extremes of the endplate surface.
   Reported as the chord through the two corners, not the RANSAC plane itself, because
   the endplate is CONCAVE and the clinical line bridges that concavity: it is drawn
   corner to corner, the same construction a Cobb angle uses.

       spinal curvature." Eur Spine J 2009;18(5):593-607.

    taken per axial section instead, and sections with no canal (above and below its

    `canal_from` supplies a LARGER mask to find the canal in, while the cut is still

    Why an intersection rather than the extreme surface voxel: a corner is a CONSTRUCTED
    point, not an observed one. Taking the last voxel on the endplate stops wherever the
    cortex begins to curve up into the posterior wall, which lands the posterosuperior
    corner short -- visible on an overlay as a posterior corner that quits before the
    body surface turns. Extending the endplate tangent to meet the wall line is exactly
    what a reader draws, and it stays well defined where the surface itself is not.

    Osteophyte handling comes free: each of the four lines is fitted by RANSAC over its
    own cortical margin, and a spondylophyte is a gross outlier to both the plate it
    grows from and the wall it projects past, so it cannot move either line. This is the
    morphometric convention -- measure the body, ignore the spur.

    the normal biconcave endplate (Hurxthal's middle height, Am J Roentgenol 1968, exists

    both show up as large residuals and Tukey's biweight gives them zero weight -- they
    are excluded because they do not fit the anatomy, not because a threshold was tuned
    to them. Raising `degree` would let the model absorb the pathology and defeat this.

    Unlike RANSAC this keeps ALL of the plate: every inlier contributes, weighted. RANSAC
    picks one consensus set and discards the rest, which is why it could lock confidently
