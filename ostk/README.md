# ostk — OpenSpineToolkit kit

Reusable, **tested** primitives for building spinopelvic measurements from
CTSpinoPelvic1K masks. Functions are pure/stateless → reproducible (no RNG; fixed
sign conventions), low-latency (vectorised + closed-form fits), and picklable for
process-pool parallelism. See the shared contract in [`../SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md).

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python -m pytest          # 27 analytic + phantom + CLI tests
```

**Modules**
- `io` — `load_label`, `load_ct`, `voxels_to_world`, `voxel_volume_mm3`
- `geometry` — `fit_sphere`, `fit_plane_tls`, `principal_axes`, `angle_between`, `project_out`, `unit`, `cobb_angle`, `signed_angle_in_plane`, `WORLD_SUPERIOR`
- `masks` — `binary_mask`, `mask_world`, `world_centroid`, `largest_component`, `surface_slab`, `endplate_points`
- `labels` — `LABELS`, `lid()` (the v3/v4 id scheme — no magic numbers)
- `record` — `Measurement` (the per-case output contract)
- `metrics` — Greenberg §73 spinopelvic stack: `pelvic_incidence[_from_label]` (PI/SS/PT), `lumbar_lordosis[_from_label]` (LL + per-segment), `pi_ll_mismatch`, `ll_increase_needed` (Eq. 73.1), `schwab_sagittal_modifiers`, and `spinopelvic_summary_from_label` (everything in one call)
- `cli` — `python -m ostk {pi,ll,all}` batch runner over a `labels/` folder
- `parallel` — `map_cases(fn, items, workers)`

**Run over a dataset (CLI)**
```bash
python -m ostk all --labels labels/ --out summary.csv --workers 8
# per-case detail: --out summary.jsonl
```

**Compose a measurement (library)**
```python
from ostk import load_label, spinopelvic_summary_from_label, map_cases

def summarise(case_id):
    label, affine = load_label(f"labels/{case_id}.nii.gz")
    return spinopelvic_summary_from_label(label, affine, case_id=case_id)

results = map_cases(summarise, case_ids, workers=8)   # PI/SS/PT/LL/PI-LL/Schwab per case
```

**What's implemented (Greenberg §73):** PI/SS/PT, LL (total + per-segment), PI−LL
mismatch + SRS-Schwab modifiers + Eq. 73.1 LL-increase. **Out of scope** (no C7/T1
on supine CT): SVA, TPA. PI is the flagship (valid on supine CT); its absolute
convention + LL are to be confirmed against manual measurement (Paper 2, Aim 2/3).
Geometry cores and the PI=SS+PT / Cobb identities are unit-tested on analytic
phantoms; `_from_label` extraction is the approximate glue pending that validation.

## Known inefficiency: the femoral heads are fitted twice

`spinopelvic_summary_from_label` fits each femoral head sphere **twice** per case — once
in `_pi_from_label_core` for the hip axis, and again in `_lr_axis_from_label`, which
derives the sagittal plane from the same two centres. Four sphere fits where two would do,
and the sphere fit is the most expensive primitive in the call.

Nothing is wrong with the answer; both fits are identical by construction. Hoisting the two
centres into the summary and passing them into both paths would roughly halve the runtime
of `ostk all`. Left alone for now because it is a pure optimisation and the released
numbers were computed with it as it stands.
